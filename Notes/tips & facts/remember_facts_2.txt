* Type checking :
  -----------
   do not check type with `==` 
    Eg type(o) == tuple

   In such case subclass will fail i.e violation of Liskov Substitution Principle

   So checking type equality is violation of Liskov Substitution Principle

   use `isinstance()`  instead


* sys.getsizeof() doesn't count size of memory of sub-objects

* Python silently handles the StopIteration & GeneratorExit exception

* __init_subclass__() is called whenever class sub classes subclass the parent class

* The built-in namespace doesnâ€™t behave like a dictionary. Python implements it as a module.

* In python when you raise custom exception from some other Exception occured in code 
  & you want to prevent the call-stack then you can use  :-
    raise CustomExceptinClass() from None  // this will only show CustomExceptinClass stack trace & not all rest other above it

=> Python scopes are dictionaries that map names to objects.
