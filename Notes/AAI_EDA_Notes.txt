Tips : 

  Always read the scale of the plot
  
  In seaborn hue='' value is determined based on label column name

__________________________

* Terms :
    -> n dimension = n features.
       legend = what color is what class label

       linearly seperability - by drawing line you can determine class_label

__________________________

* pandas
  ------

   df['co_name'].value_counts()  // gives counts for each value

* numpy 
  -----
   np.zeros_like()
   np.histogram()
   np.cumsum(pdf)    //cdf from pdf

* Seaborn :
  -------
   -> sns.set_style("whitegrid")
         .FacetGrid(df, hue=, size=)
             \
              .add_legend()

    Scatter Plots :
    
      -> to plot for 2D or 3D
    
    pair-plots :
      
      -> Hack to visualise data in more than 3D space i.e (4D, 5D, ... ,nD) 

    Histogram :

      -> Histogram makes more sense than 1D Scatter Plot (as it shows count for small-windows)

* balanced dataset:
  --------------
  -> same count for all values in single column of class_label 
     (i.e value_counts() result in same value for all)


* PDF
  ---
   -> PDF is a smooth form of a histogram
   -> take a histogram & smooth it up

* CDF
  ---
   -> what percentage of class_label(on y axis) has value <= feature value (on x axis) 
      all probablity lies between 0 & 1

   -> area under the curve till that point(on x axis)


REMEMBER : diff of CDF = PDF
 
           Integration of PDF = CDF
