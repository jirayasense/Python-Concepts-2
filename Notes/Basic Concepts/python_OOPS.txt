* new() vs init():
  ------------  
   __new__ :- call to create object 
   __init__ :- to add attrib to that object

   new :- return object 
   init :- do not return anything

   generlly signature of both are same

   new :- is a class method     (cls)
   init :- is a instance method (self)

   => Always remember to return something from new (as that is its job)

   new :- Change how obj is created


   init :- when called obj is already created 
   
   So if you want to perform anything during or before object creation use __new__ 
   else you can go with __init__

   So __new__ is often used when to deal with immutable object 
   as immutable obj cannot be altered once created 

* classmethod & staticmethod 
  ----------------
   to call classmethod from innstance method use :- type(self).classMethodName()
