* Python is compiled but not to Machine code but to Byte Code 
  This Byte Code is used then by the interpreter

  .pyc files is compiled python files


* In python an assignment is not expression but statement & its done from left to right (in case of chained one)

* Exception :
  -----
   -> To silence the raised exception (ie dont want the callback stack)
       \
        -> use :- raise Exception('error string') from None 

  
=> GeneratorExit exception is not same as Exception

* Dictionary View Objects :
  ----------
   => keys() & values() 
       \
        -> these are windows to the underlying dictionary objects 
           So whennever any update happens on the dictionary it will reflect immediately
           (ie kinda Reactive)


* Scopes :
  ----
   Python scopes are dictionaries that map names to objects.


* Lexiographical Sorting Ordering :
  ------
   -> In python when you compare 2 strings they are compared LexioGraphically character by character
