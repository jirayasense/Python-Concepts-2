[Python Interpreter Working] 
---------
* Python is compiled but not to Machine code but to Byte Code 
  This Byte Code is used then by the interpreter

  .pyc files is compiled python files  (For C Lang)


* In python an assignment is not expression but statement & its done from left to right (in case of chained one)

* Exception :
  -----
   -> To silence the raised exception (ie dont want the callback stack)
       \
        -> use :- raise Exception('error string') from None 

  
=> GeneratorExit exception is not same as Exception

* Dictionary View Objects :
  ----------
   => keys() & values() 
       \
        -> these are windows to the underlying dictionary objects 
           So whennever any update happens on the dictionary it will reflect immediately
           (ie kinda Reactive)


* Scopes :
  ----
   Python scopes are dictionaries that map names to objects.

   local & global :
     -> Whether or not a variable is Free Variable or Local Variable is determined at Compile time &
        Not at run time


* Lexiographical Sorting Ordering :
  ------
   -> In python when you compare 2 strings they are compared LexioGraphically character by character


* format() :
  ----
   - use to formate value usinng format specifier
   - return String
   - uses __format__ underhood
