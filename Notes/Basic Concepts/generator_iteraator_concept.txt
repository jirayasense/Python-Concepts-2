* Generators :
 ----------
  ->  Python yield statement is certainly the linchpin 
      on which all of the functionality of generators rests


* next() & Iterators or generators :
  --------
   -> When you use next() manually on Iterator or Gennerator then on Exhausted
      it will give StopIteration Exception 

      To avoid that you can provide default val in next() as second argument
