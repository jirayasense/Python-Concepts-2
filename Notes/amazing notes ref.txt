* builtins :
  -------
   -> module representing the builtins identifiers available in python

* Python 3 does not allow the indiscriminate `import * syntax` from within a function


* sign bit in python :
  -------
   -> Since integers in Python can have an infinite number of bits, the sign bit doesn’t have a fixed position. 
      So there’s no sign bit at all in Python


* Python & Terminal & Path & Relativeness :
  --------------
   -> When you run your python script in VsCode then it actually run like this way 

      "Path_To_Python" "Path_To_Script"

      This will get run in Folder which is currently opened in VsCode as a project/root.

      So that Project location will be considered as refer point for relative paths in 
       any of its descendents python scripts.

       So you need to keep in mind the Folder in which python is running script,
       instead of path of script.
